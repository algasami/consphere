                    Consphere is a static website making use of webpack, typescript and various packages
                    to aid its development. It is almost framework-less in pursuit of a simple yet
                    versatile website. It is a small hobby project developed occasionally.

                <h2>Why go framework-less?</h2>
                <p>
                    While frameworks such as Angular and Next.js have been proven to be extremely
                    powerful and convenient, speaking of my personal experience working with them,
                    I find myself knowing nothing about the web when focusing on the more low-level
                    aspect of it. I argue that it is largely owing to the fact that these frameworks
                    have layers of abstraction that make things more "dev-friendly". They are
                    well-designed, nevertheless, having possibilities of creating illusions of the
                    underlying mechanisms of the web behind the hood. The above-mentioned reason is why
                    I choose to go framework-less on this specific project.

                    I'm still contemplating what to do with this repository, but you may see further
